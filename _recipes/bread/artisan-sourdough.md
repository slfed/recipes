title: Artisan sourdough
source: 
yield: 1 large loaf
time: 2 days
notes: 
ingredients:
- 350 grams bread flour (preferably organic) 
- 90 grams whole wheat flour (preferably organic and stone-ground) 
- 330 grams 32°C filtered water 
- 90 grams ripe sourdough starter (100% hydration) 
- 9 grams kosher salt or fine sea salt 
method:
- Day 1
- 8:30 autolyse (mix flours and water). allow mixture to rest, covered, at 26°C for 1 hour, or as long as 2 hours. 
- 9:30  add mature sourdough starter, mix thoroughly. cover and rest at 26°C for 30 minutes.
- 10:00 add salt and mix thoroughly. cover and rest at 26°C for 15 minutes.
- 10:00 - 11:15  stretch and folds 1, 2, 3 (every 15 minutes). cover and rest at 26°C between each set. 
- 11:15 - 12:30  stretch and folds 4, 5, 6 (every 30 minutes). cover and rest at 26°C between each set. 
- 12:30 - 15:15 allow dough to rest, covered, at 26°C for the rest of the bulk fermentation period. this period will range from 1.5 – 2 hours (or much longer), depending on ambient temperature, starter strength, and flour variety. End bulk fermentation when the dough is just under double in size. 
- 15:15 pre-shape. leave uncovered at room temperature for 20 minutes.
- 15:35 final shape. transfer to rice floured banneton basket, cover with a plastic bag, and seal. allow to rest at room  temperature for 10 minutes before transferring to the fridge.
- 15:45 retard dough (final proof) in refrigerator at 3°C for 16-17 hours. 
- Day 2
- 6:45 preheat Challenger Pan, Dutch Oven, or combo cooker in 260°C oven for at least 1 hour. 
- 7:45 remove dough from the fridge, transfer to preheated pan, score, and bake at 260°C with the lid on for 25 minutes. 
- 8:10 remove pan lid, reduce oven temperature to 245°C and bake uncovered for about 20 minutes or until deeply caramelized. allow loaf to cool completely – this will take several hours – before slicing and serving.
