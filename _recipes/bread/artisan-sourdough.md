source: [abeautifulplate](https://www.abeautifulplate.com/artisan-sourdough-bread-recipe/)
yield: 1 large loaf
time: 2 days
notes: This is a slighty reduced hydration version of the linked recipe. 
ingredients:
- 350 grams bread flour (preferably organic) 
- 90 grams whole wheat flour (preferably organic and stone-ground) 
- 330 grams 32°C filtered water 
- 90 grams ripe sourdough starter (100% hydration) 
- 9 grams kosher salt or fine sea salt 
method:
- Day 1
- 8:30 AM – autolyse (mix flours and water). allow mixture to rest, covered, at 26°C for 1 hour, or as long as 2 hours. 
- 9:30 AM – add mature sourdough starter, mix thoroughly. cover and rest at 26°C for 30 minutes.
- 10:00 AM – add salt and mix thoroughly. cover and rest at 26°C for 15 minutes.
- 10:15 AM – 10:45 AM – stretch and folds #1, #2, #3 (every 15 minutes). cover and rest at 26°C between each set. 
- 11:15 AM – 12:15 PM – stretch and folds #4, #5, #6 (every 30 minutes). cover and rest at 26°C between each set. 
- 12:15 PM – 2:15/3:15 PM – allow dough to rest, covered, at 26°C for the rest of the bulk fermentation period. this period will range from 1.5 – 2 hours (or much longer), depending on ambient temperature, starter strength, and flour variety. Generally, I like to end bulk fermentation when the dough is just under double in size. This has produced good results for me - and this guideline works well for this specific sourdough process and timeline. 
- 2:15/3:15 PM – pre-shape. leave uncovered at room temperature for 20 minutes.
- 2:35/3:35 PM – final shape. transfer to rice floured banneton basket, cover with a plastic bag, and seal. allow to rest at room - temperature for 10 minutes before transferring to the fridge.
- 3:45 PM – 7:45 AM  – retard dough (final proof) in refrigerator at 3°C for 16-17 hours. 
- Day 2
- 6:45 AM – preheat Challenger Pan, Dutch Oven, or combo cooker in 260°C oven for at least 1 hour. 
- 7:45 AM – remove dough from the fridge, transfer to preheated pan, score, and bake at 260°C with the lid on for 25 - minutes. 
- 8:10 AM – remove pan lid, reduce oven temperature to 245°C and bake uncovered for about 20 minutes or until deeply - caramelized. allow loaf to cool completely – this will take several hours – before slicing and serving.
